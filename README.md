# Printable Atoms
3D printable, ab initio-accurate models of atomic and molecular structures. 

Filenames that end in 30p mean the isosurface contains 30% of the total electron density. Filenames that end with 0.450_epA3 mean the isosurface was chosen at 0.450 electrons/Angstrom**3. The scale is 1 mm in the STL is 1 Angstrom in the simulation. We recommend to increasing the scale by 10x so that 1 cm => 1 Angstrom for the best printing experience.
